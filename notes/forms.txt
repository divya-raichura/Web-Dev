The value attribute specifies the value of an <input> element. The value attribute is used differently for different input types: For "button", "reset", and "submit" - it defines the text on the button. For "text", "password", and "hidden" - it defines the initial (default) value of the input field.
For "checkbox", "radio", "image" - it defines the value associated with the input (this is also the value that is sent on submit)
